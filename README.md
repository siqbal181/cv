## Sidra Iqbal

I am a former digital Account Director with 5+ years of experience working at a leading agency, where I managed a team of 8 across the largest accounts in the business, with yearly budgets exceeding £20m. Throughout my career, I have successfully launched several key projects such as elevating Marks & Spencers audience strategy and project managing a £1m+ app campaign. This enabled me to be the quickest to be promoted to Account Director within the agencies history. My interest in tech began when I noticed several examples of where tech elevated client success, with some examples being through automating a process or creating a machine learning algoritm to increase revenue. This is where my interest for tech first stemmed from, and I am excited to utilize my project management, marketing technology and leadership skills to propel myself into a developer role.

## Skills

#### Communication
- I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room.
- My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic.

#### Project Management

- I worked with M&S to onboard their customer data platform and create a strategy on how to use their audiences in our campaigns to further drive revenue. This involved creating a roadmap for this project, which allowed us to see all the relevant timelines of when we would be activating the audiences, as well as relevant stakeholders responsible for each action. This also allowed me to keep track of internal responsibilities and keep track of who was accountable for each stage.
- I have led several projects for clients which utilise complicated marketing technologies, and have often recieved feedback from clients that I do a great job of breaking down the project technical dependencies into ways in which the client can understand.

#### Leadership Experience
- I led an internal M&S working group, which involved collaborating with several members of leadership (including the CFO and CGO) to discuss how we could elevate our service levels to align with key stakeholder expectations.
- I was appointed to a role in the agency leadership team, and worked with the Head of Biddable to develop the agency's proposition and increase gross profit, by finding new revenue streams and upselling additional services.
- I was one of 3 people chosen for an external training programme, designed to develop up-and-coming diverse talent for leadership positions.

#### Team Management
- I have been a manager at some capacity since 2019 and have learnt a huge deal from managing different people with varying approaches to work and communication styles.
- Whilst being a team manager, I also managed my teams progression and guided them on their progression pathway in quarterly reviews.
